# Clog, Pie's in-house custom logger
Clog, which stands for 3 things:
- Colored Log
- Click Log
- Custom Log

is a simple logger that follows a few programming standards (all are from The Zen of Python by Tim Peters, except for the sub-points):
- Simple is better than complex
- Complex is better than complicated
    - There should be no need for docs, because everything will be self-explainatory
    - Although docs would be nice
- Readability counts
    - None of this one-liner crap. 
- In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    - Don't assume **anything**. If you don't have enough info on the environment you're running on, stick to the most compatible option
- There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
    - This one is self-explainatory. None of these "60,000 ways to do it shenanigans".
